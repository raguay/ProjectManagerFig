## Project Manager for Fig

This is a project manager application for the [fig](https://docs.withfig.com/) terminal 
assistant. This app will tie into my [Project Manager for fman](https://github.com/raguay/ProjectManager) 
and [Project Manager for Alfred](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/Alfred%204/Project%20Manager.alfredworkflow). 
The goal is to have a nice, integrated way to work in and change projects.
