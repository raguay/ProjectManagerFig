## Project Manager for Fig

This is a ongoing project to create the ultimate project management addon to 
fig. I am constantly adding to it with new ideas.

### Current Working

- testing....
- Adding new templates in the Edit Templates isn't working.
- It is possible to add the same template more than once.
- Seems to be an issue showing the notes.

### Finished

- Add the ability to use the project notes created by the fman plugin Notes.
